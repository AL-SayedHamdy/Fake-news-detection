# Fake-news-detection
This NLP model is detecting the fake news and the true news, that can be so useful in the middle of all things we are living these days. I used in this model some tools like the count vectorizer and TF-IDF. This model has so good accuracy that reaches 94% correction.

The dataset is from kaggle.com and this is the link (https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

This model was made by Spyder editior.
